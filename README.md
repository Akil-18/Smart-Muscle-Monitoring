**(Ongoing Project)**




**1. AIM**

_(I) Purpose_

  1. The purpose of the Smart Muscle Monitoring Project is to monitor muscle activity in real-time using sensors like the ICM20948 (9-DOF IMU) and MyoWare EMG sensors.
  
  2. The project aims to analyze muscle movements and provide feedback on exercise form, which can help in optimizing workout routines and preventing injuries.
  
  3. Additionally, the project incorporates AWS IoT connectivity to store and analyze the data in the cloud.


_(II) Inputs_

  1. ICM20948 (9-DOF IMU Sensor): Provides accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data.
    
  2. MyoWare EMG Sensor: Measures muscle activity by detecting the electrical potential generated by muscle cells.


_(III) Outputs_

  1. Cloud Storage and Analysis: Sensor data stored in AWS IoT for further analysis.
    
  2. ML-Based Feedback:
     
  • Alerts when muscle fatigue is detected during exercises.

  • Real-time feedback on exercise form to help improve technique.
  
  • Actionable insights delivered through a mobile app.




**2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

_(I) Sensor Initialization_

  1. Acquire continuous data from ICM20948 and EMG Sensor


_(II) Data Acquisition_

  1. Continuously acquire and buffer data from the ICM20948 and MyoWare sensors.
  
  2. Store data temporarily in RAM when Wi-Fi is connected.


_(III) Buffering Strategy_

  1. Wi-Fi Connected: Buffer data in internal RAM for quick access and periodic flushing to the cloud.
  
  2. Wi-Fi Lost: Shift to SRAM (23LC512) for buffering data when Wi-Fi connectivity is lost.
  
  3. Wi-Fi Restored: Flush the buffered data from SRAM to the cloud once Wi-Fi is reconnected, then clear SRAM and resume buffering in internal RAM.


_(IV) Data Transmission_

  1. Send the buffered data to AWS IoT when Wi-Fi is connected.
  
  2. Ensure seamless transition between Wi-Fi states without data loss.


_(V) Sensor Fusion_

  1. Implement Sensor Fusion algorithms to combine data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to produce accurate and stable orientation data (roll, pitch, yaw).
  
  2. Use Kalman Filter or Madgwick Filter for sensor fusion.


_(VI) Machine Learning Integration_

  1. Utilize ML models hosted on AWS to analyze sensor data in real-time.
  
  2. Detect muscle fatigue and evaluate exercise form based on sensor data.
  
  3. Provide real-time feedback to users based on the ML analysis.




**3. NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**


_Real-time Performance_

1. The system must operate in real-time, ensuring minimal latency in data acquisition, transmission, and ML-based feedback.


_Light Weight and Small Size_

2. This is essential for user comfort, especially when the device is worn during physical activities.
